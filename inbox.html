    <h1>A Brief History of the Croissant</h1>
    <h2>Learn all about the iconic Viennese-turned-French pastry</h2>

    <p>
      Rich, flaky and the perfect complement to your morning cup of coffee, the
      croissant is the quintessential French pastry. But how did the croissant
      come to be? To celebrate National Croissant Day, we’re taking a deep dive
      into the history of the croissant, complete with input from ICE’s Director
      of Pastry Research & Development, Chef Jürgen David. Across various
      accounts of croissant history, most sources agree that it originates from
      Austria as the kipferl. Made from a yeasted wheat dough, the kipferl is a
      baked bread roll common in Central Europe. Records state that the kipferl
      has been around as early as the 13th century, but many believe it may be
      even older. Popular myths attribute its invention as a celebration of the
      Ottoman Empire’s defeat in the Battle of Vienna; the crescent shape
      represented the moon on the Ottoman flag. “These stories are almost
      certainly untrue,” Austrian native Chef Jürgen says. Regardless of the
      kipferl’s origins, it would migrate to France later in the 19th century.
      In another common legend, Marie Antoinette is said to have introduced the
      kipferl to French court, homesick for foods from Austria. While it’s a
      romantic story, there are no historical records to back up this retelling.
      The earliest recorded introduction of the kipferl to France occurred in
      1839, when Austrian artillery officer August Zang founded a Viennese
      bakery in Paris. Parisians fell in love with the kipferl (and with
      Viennese baking as a whole), and imitated the bread in their own shops.
      The name "croissant" also began appearing in historical record, referring
      to the crescent shape of the bread. In 1915, Sylvain Claudius Goy recorded
      the first-known French version of the croissant recipe. Instead of brioche
      dough, as August Zang used, Goy transformed the recipe to use a laminated
      yeast dough. Lamination involves folding butter and dough to create thin,
      flaky layers of pastry. And thus, the iconic French pastry we know and
      love today was born.

      Most of us today are familiar with frozen croissants, accessible at
      grocery stores, bakeries and restaurants. They're a relatively new
      invention born of innovation. As technology modernized, the Sara Lee
      corporation in America pioneered a method to freeze croissant dough for
      shipping in 1981. The frozen dough only needed to be quickly baked before
      serving. This allowed businesses to employ unskilled labor and for people
      to make croissants at home with ease. Through its many evolutions, food
      experts and historians agree that the croissant has become a uniquely
      French pastry. The French government even named it as the national French
      product in 1920. Many other countries also have their own spin-offs of the
      croissant. From Spain’s cream-filled Xuixo to the American fast-food
      croissan’wich, it’s truly a staple of modern global cuisine. Chef Jürgen,
      who learned pastry arts in Vienna, Austria, is a croissant connoisseur.
      “When I worked in Switzerland, my job was to roll the croissants in the
      morning and it was the best thing,” he says. “I’m a big fan of anything
      laminated. There aren't any special tricks, and it’s fun to roll out all
      the layers.” His favorite is a good old-fashioned curved croissant, plain
      and simple. As he puts it: “I just love making — and eating — croissants.”
