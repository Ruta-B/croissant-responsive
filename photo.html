           <h3> Ingredients list:</h3>
To make homemade croissants, you don’t need much ingredients, however, it is important to choose them well.  
<ul>
<li>Flour: Ideally, a mix of all-purpose flour and a bread flour, rich un gluten such as T45 flour. If you only have all purpose wheat flour, that will work too!</li> 
<li>Dry yeast: I use active dry yeast that comes in a little. You don’t need to activate it before using it. </li>
<li>Sugar: I use white sugar. </li>
<li>Salt: I use fine table salt.</li>
<li>Water: You must use cold or room temperature water.</li>
<li>Milk: I recommend whole milk (3.5% fat). You must use cold milk. </li>
<li>Butter: This is of course the most important ingredient in this recipe. I recommend a French or at least European unsalted butter, with a minimum fat content of 82%. Your butter must be cold and not soft! This is very important to be able to work the dough better.</li> 
      </ul>
